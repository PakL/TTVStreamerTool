	<h2>It is time to let this go</h2>
	<p>First of all: if you're reading this, thank you!</p>
	<p>TTVST has been something I've been passionate about for a very long time but internally always struggled to justify keeping alive. I knew that I created a tool for a niche marked and being the sole developer I knew it would never reach the quality it would require to get adopted even in a small circle inside that niche. I have often considered to let it go but had always found a reason to bounce back and find something that similar tools don't provide.</p>
	<p>In the past 2 years that TTVST has not gotten a single update I had ideas to improve this tool but most of these ideas are too big for me to do alone. Especially considering the projects I am working on besides TTVST. So I just have to face the fact that I simply do not have the time to work on this anymore. TTVST has started to loom over me like a dark cloud and it is time to rid myself of it.</p>
