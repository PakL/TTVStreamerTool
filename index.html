	<p>TTVStreamerTool (TTVST) is an application aimed at Twitch streamer. Since the first major version TTVStreamerTool
		has transformed from a chat tool with some HTTP overlays to an automation tool, though you may choose to use it
		in another way. And that's fine. The goal of this tool is to grow with it's users. The more people use it and
		have ideas on how to improve it the better. TTVST is build modularly so you only install the modules (called
		Addons) that you need so you can focus on what is important to you.</p>

	<h4>Platform</h4>
	<p>The TTVStreamerTool is developed and tested on an Windows 10 x64 system. I guess everything >= Windows 8 should
		work.<br>Linux or MacOS are <strong>not</strong> supported.</p>

	<h4>SmartScreen/Antivirus issue</h4>
	<p>Microsoft's SmartScreen for Windows will (most likely) block the execution of this Setup file. This is because I
		have no interest to invest a lot of money in a code signing certificate. You can still execute the setup by
		clicking "More info" on the SmartScreen screen.<br>
		Other Antivirus software might detect some parts of TTVST as viruses as well. They are most likely all false
		positives. I take great care about what I upload and provide to you as download.<br>
		<strong>Please make sure that you only execute files from sources that you trust!</strong></p>

	<h4>What it looks like</h4>

	<p>Don't worry about the color. TTVST will take on your OS accent color.</p>
