TTVStreamerTool (TTVST) is an application aimed at Twitch streamer. Since the first major version TTVStreamerTool has transformed from a chat tool with some HTTP overlays to an automation tool, though you may choose to use it in another way. And that's fine. The goal of this tool is to grow with it's users. The more people use it and have ideas on how to improve it the better. TTVST is build modularly so you only install the modules (called Addons) that you need so you can focus on what is important to you.

### Platform

The TTVStreamerTool is developed and tested on an Windows 10 x64 system. I guess everything >= Windows 8 should work.

Linux or MacOS are **not** supported.
