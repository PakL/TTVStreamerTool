# TTVStreamerTool

This is going to be a tool Twitch streamer can use to see what's going on.

I'm not sure what features it's going to have, so no promises.

### How to install
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Tested with v6.9.1, should be compatible with all v6 versions)
* Download and unpack source code somewhere
* Open a command line and execute inside source code directory:
```
> npm install
```
* It should now install a lot of packages
* When finished you can start the program with
```
> npm start
```
You can, of course, create a script or batch to execute this command more easily.

#### Important when updating source
Make sure you execute `npm update` in case I added new node modules or updated the existing one.
