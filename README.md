# TTVStreamerTool

This is going to be a tool Twitch streamer can use to see what's going on.

I'm not sure what features it's going to have, so no promises.

### Platform
The TTVStreamerTool is developed and tested on an Windows 10 x64 system. I guess everything >= Windows 8 should work.

Linux or MacOS are **not** supported. *You could download the source code and tweak it here and there to make it work though...*

### Install
Download the zip in the [v0.1.2 release](https://github.com/PakL/TTVStreamerTool/releases/tag/v0.1.2) and unpack it somewhere you don't need elevated writing rights. This is because the auto updater needs to overwrite some files there. You could start the program as an administrator but this is not recommended.

After unpacking start the tool by double clicking the `ttv-streamertool.exe`.

There are some optional addons (these `.asar` files) in the [v0.1.1 release](https://github.com/PakL/TTVStreamerTool/releases/tag/v0.1.1) you can download and put in the `resources` folder.

Please feel free to report any issues on the [Github isses pages](https://github.com/PakL/TTVStreamerTool/issues).
