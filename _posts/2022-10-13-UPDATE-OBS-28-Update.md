I just released the obsremote update that will work with OBS 28.

All your actions will still function the same way. However I will add more actions in the future to take advantage of the new features.

If you require legacy support for older OBS versions and obs-websocket 4.x you can install obsremotelegacy, which is just version 1.1.0 with a new name.
**DO NOT INSTALL BOTH VERSIONS!**
