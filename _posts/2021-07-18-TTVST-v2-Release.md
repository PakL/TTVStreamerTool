I'm very excited to present you the first stable-ish release of TTVSTv2.

After a long period of real life testing I can confidently say that the main application is now working better than
expected. 

There are still some issues with some addons and some missing common event triggers (hosts, raids and follows). But they
can be fixed later. The manual for the chatbot is also not ready yet. However with the announcement of the shutdown of
Twitch's v5 API I wanted to get TTVSTv2 in the hands of those who want to use it because v1 will cease to function after
the 28th of February 2022, so giving people the opportunity to make the switch early was important to me.
