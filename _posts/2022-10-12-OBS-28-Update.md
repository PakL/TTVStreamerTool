On September 1st 2022 the OBS Project released OBS version 28. Which comes with the obs websocket plugin build in.
The plugin also got a huge update and improved features and better compatibility with other third party plugins.
Sadly it breaks everything and is not compatible with previous versions of the websocket protocol.

I am already working on an update for the obsremote addon for TTVST but since I want your experience to be unchanged
I need to do some serious work that takes me longer than expected.

If you rely on obsremote to work you need to stay off the OBS update for now.
I want to appologize for any inconvenience that may cause.
