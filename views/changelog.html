		<ul>
			<li>Updated electron to version 2.0.0</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			With the Electron 2.0.0 came a feature to hint to some possible security concerns. Complying to these some changes had to be made, making current addons incompatible. So I had to add a check to which version the addon is compatible and not load it if not. All official addons were have an update you can install to make them work again.
