This page serves to display errors from the current session. You can also open the folder with all past error logs. If
something's not working correctly you may see why here.

Not all errors are critical. There might just be a connection error or something. Please don't report errors just
because they're here. Only post error logs when asked and check the logs for sensible information before sending them!
