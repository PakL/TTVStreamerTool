Addons are the way to add functionality to the TTVST. If you open the addon page you'll start on the list of installed
addons. To view all addons that are available to install change to the "Available" tab at to top. You can select
multiple addons by clicking on the checkbox to the left of the addons.

There are some symbols that you should know:
* **Star**: A star indicates that a new version for an addon is available
* **Broken bulb**: A broken light bulb indicates that the addon is broken and could not be loaded properly
