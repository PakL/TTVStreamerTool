File Access lets you, as the name already tells you, access files on your system. You can read lines from files or write
lines to them. You can also watch files for changes.

After installing the addon go to settings to setup the folders that the addon is allowed to read from.

Since errors go mostly unnoticed with TTVST actions you can check if the file is read-/writeable via sperate actions.
