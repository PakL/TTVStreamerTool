The dashboard provides you fast and easy access to the twitch dashboard or moderation tools. Depending on your settings
you can start of in the moderation view, the creator dashboard or your channel view. By default the FrankerFaceZ extension
is also loaded. You can disable this in the settings menu.

With FrankerFaceZ enabled I have recreated a user favorite feature to join multiple chat channels by using the
`/join [channel]` command. To leave a channel type `/part [channel]`.

Audio will be disabled if you open another page in the tool. The dashboard will unload the website completely when it's
closed for 10 minutes to free up system resources.
